ðŸ”’ What is CORS?
CORS is a security feature in web browsers that prevents a website from making a request to a different website (domain) unless that website allows it.


âœ… Simple Example:
Imagine:
You are on the website ebay.com
This website wants to get some data from an API on google.com.
By default, google.com will block this request â€” it doesn't want just any site asking for its data.
This is because of CORS rules.


ðŸ§  Why do we have CORS?
To protect your data and prevent malicious websites from secretly reading data from other websites (like your emails or personal info from your bank).
